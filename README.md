## Important

Do not clone this repository or run the template directly from GitHub, as any changes you make could affect the original version. Instead, download the template as a ZIP file, extract it, and rename the folder to something different from the repository name such as 'my-project' or any name you prefer. Then, open it in Visual Studio Code to run and customize the template according to your preferences.

## Setup Instructions

1. Getting Started

(a): Download the project code ZIP file, extract it, and move it to your preferred location.

(b): Open the project in Visual Studio Code and open the terminal.

(c): Run the following commands in the terminal:

Note: The first command verifies the path. Before running it, right-click the project folder, select 'Copy Path,' and paste it in place of path/to/your/project. The second command installs dependencies, creating the node_modules folder. The third command runs the project, generating the .next folder. Both node_modules and .next are temporary folders created during the build process. They can be safely deleted once the project is completed and deployed or is no longer needed. However, they will be recreated if you run npm install, npm run dev, or npm run build again.

```bash

# Verify the path to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

2. Set up environment variables:

   In the root directory of your project, create a new file named .env

   a. Open the existing file env.txt and copy all its contents.

   b. Paste the copied content into your new .env file.

   c. Your .env file should contain the following variables:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   ```
   d. Go to your Supabase account:

      If you already have a project named next-js-ecommerce-web-app, open it.

      If not, create a new Supabase project named next-js-ecommerce-web-app (you can use any other project name as well).

   e. In your Supabase dashboard:

      Go to Settings.

      Under API Keys, copy the key and paste it into:

      ```bash
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
      ```
      Under Data API, copy the project URL and paste it into:

      ```bash
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
      ```
      
      ✅ Example (.env)
      ```bash
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
      ```

## 🔄 Stripe Integration (Optional)

**Current Status**: Using placeholder keys for testing

**To enable real payments:**
1. Get your Stripe API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
   ```
3. Restart the application
4. Set up Stripe webhook for payment confirmations (optional but recommended)
   
### Database Setup

1. Open the file supabase-schema.sql in your project folder and copy all the SQL code from that file.

2. Go to your Supabase Dashboard and open your project. In the left sidebar, click on “SQL Editor” (under the Database section). In the SQL Editor window, paste the copied SQL code. Click on the “Run” button at the top right.

   This will:
   
   (a) Create all required tables
   
   (b) Set up the necessary Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   
   Note: You can view the newly created tables by navigating to Database → Tables in your Supabase dashboard.
